# reverberate
Author: Jade Chan, Date: Oct 3, 2016

### SUMMARY
This was intended as an opportunity for me to play around with SVG's (using D3, a javascript
library). Here, I've represented the word "Reverberate".

---

### TODO's
Currently, all of the options (number of rings, color, size, duration of fadein / fadeout) are
all global varibles. This can easily be changed to take user input, making this project more 
interactive.
